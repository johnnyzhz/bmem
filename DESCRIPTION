Description: Four methods for mediation analysis with missing data: Listwise deletion, Pairwise deletion, Multiple imputation, and Two Stage Maximum Likelihood algorithm. For MI and TS-ML, auxiliary variables can be included. Bootstrap confidence intervals for mediation effects are obtained. The robust method is also implemented for TS-ML. Since version 1.4, bmem adds the capability to conduct power analysis for mediation models.
